After completion of the filling process, the bottles are moved on the conveyor for packing process. Here the objective is to detect and remove if any empty bottle is found on the conveyor. 
I have used two proximity sensors for bottle detection and empty bottle detection.
One proximity sensor is calibrated such that it detects only empty bottle and other one is calibrated such that it detects all bottle. Conveyor is used for bottle transportation. Cylinder is used to throw empty bottle out of the conveyor.
